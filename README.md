This is a small addon that adds information about the loot one can acquire from completing a keystone.

It provides the keystone's:

* minimum available item level upon completion.
* weekly chest reward item level.
This addon was originally called [MythicPlusLoot](https://wow.curseforge.com/projects/mythicplusloot) by [Artanisx](https://wow.curseforge.com/members/Artanisx).

Credit goes to them, I merely updated it and added Residuum amounts.
