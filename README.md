This is a small addon that adds information about the loot one can acquire from completing a keystone.

It provides the keystone's:

* Dungeon reward item level.
* weekly vault reward item level.
* A slash command to get reward information for a specific level. "/kt 3" gives you the rewards for keystone level 3.
